Block container of HTML in-line content. Headings, paragraphs, lists and more.

If you need to use specific elements you can refer to their components.

```javascript
<Content>
    <h1>Arwes</h1>
    <p>Futuristic Sci-Fi and Cyberpunk Graphical User Interface Framework for Web Apps</p>
</Content>
```

Global styles are still applied by `<Arwes />` component.
