## Purpose

Arwes is an intent to materialize futuristic science fiction concepts in a toolset
to let you create interfaces that inspire advanced technology, especially spatial,
influenced by alien conceptions.

Connected, augmented, and energized are the feelings sought in the experiences
provided with projects built with Arwes. So the interfaces are intensive and rich.

But building modular, configurable, heavy animated and interconnected interface
components for web applications from both design and functional perspectives
it's not easy. Since there are plenty of ideas where to get inspiration from, the
concepts used here are opinionated and focus on certain aspects to experience.

These are the main fundamental ideas behind this project.

### Advanced Alien Technology

The elements should looks like they were made with advanced technology based on
many fundamentally new scientific theories and created by developed alien
civilizations or human societies millennia away in the future.

But written and spoken language with letters and numbers is still used to communicate.
And mechanical interactions are still needed to manipulate the controls.

The design could be used in displays, virtual reality, augmented reality, and
even holograms, and it should give the impression user is controlling futuristic
sophisticated devices.

### Clean and Sleek

It doesn't have to be cryptic to feel advanced. Elements should be shown clearly
enough to express the ideas without getting lost in visual effects.

Sizes and spacing should be well used to convey the messages. Controls and structural
elements should not be too big to mean importance. Content should be legible and
not convoluted or obfuscated.

The interfaces should look polished and sophisticated.

### Functional

The elements in the experience should exist for a purpose, not just for display.
But they can be elaborated. These elements should express they have a function.

All components in an experience, should feel they are interconnected as a whole,
so it is not just functional but intelligent. Actions in one place, can echo the
other places or even broadcast it to the whole system.

### Energetic and Vibrant

All components should connect with the user visually and aurally. They should
feel being assembled, evolved and decomposed. Using them should be an experience
as a creator and as an explorer.

Elements glowing should inspire energy and animation should activate it. User
should feel connected with the system.
