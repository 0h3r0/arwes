# Arwes Guidelines

Arwes Design, Animation, and Effects Guidelines. It's a living guide. These are
the core concepts and ideas behind the project Arwes.

## Purpose

Arwes is an intent to materialize futuristic science fiction concepts in a toolset
to let you create interfaces that inspire advanced technology, especially spatial,
influenced by alien conceptions.

Connected, augmented, and energized are the feelings sought in the experiences
provided with projects built with Arwes. So the interfaces are intensive and rich.

But building modular, configurable, heavy animated and interconnected interface
components for web applications from both design and functional perspectives
it's not easy. Since there are plenty of ideas where to get inspiration from, the
concepts used here are opinionated and focus on certain aspects to experience.

These are the main fundamental ideas behind this project.

### Advanced Alien Technology

The elements should looks like they were made with advanced technology based on
many fundamentally new scientific theories and created by developed alien
civilizations or human societies millennia away in the future.

But written and spoken language with letters and numbers is still used to communicate.
And mechanical interactions are still needed to manipulate the controls.

The design could be used in displays, virtual reality, augmented reality, and
even holograms, and it should give the impression user is controlling futuristic
sophisticated devices.

### Clean and Sleek

It doesn't have to be cryptic to feel advanced. Elements should be shown clearly
enough to express the ideas without getting lost in visual effects.

Sizes and spacing should be well used to convey the messages. Controls and structural
elements should not be too big to mean importance. Content should be legible and
not convoluted or obfuscated.

The interfaces should look polished and sophisticated.

### Functional

The elements in the experience should exist for a purpose, not just for display.
But they can be elaborated. These elements should express they have a function.

All components in an experience, should feel they are interconnected as a whole,
so it is not just functional but intelligent. Actions in one place, can echo in
other places or even broadcast it to the whole system.

### Energetic and Vibrant

All components should connect with the user visually and aurally. By navigating,
things don't just appear or disappear. They should feel being assembled, evolved
and decomposed. Using them should be an experience as an explorer and also as a
creator.

Elements glowing should inspire energy and animation should activate it. User
should feel connected with the system.

## Design System

Arwes is a _framework_ to create UIs. Ideally most settings should be configurable.
So many of these guidelines should be flexible enough to adapt to the implementation
desired.

### Colors

Futuristic designs tend to be dark. Arwes is not an exception, it is specially
designed for dark backgrounds and light elements. But it could be configured
any way it is required.

### Fonts

The typographies tend to be rectangular and maybe oblique with techno influence.

Arwes defines two main typographies. One for the content and one for the headings
with more emphasis. All text should have the ability to "glow".
